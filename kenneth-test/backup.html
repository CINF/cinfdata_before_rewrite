<p>NOTE: The time of last update, shows the time the last point was logged to the database. This only happens for the temperature when it changes more than 0.5 &deg;C, or for the pressure when it changes more than 4%. This means that if at any time, there is a timestamp here that is more than 10 minutes old, then the chamber surveillance is not funtioning correctly and you should call Kenneth.</p>
